<p align="center"><b>OpenCode for Android Termux on ARM64 — automatic, verified, and root-free.</b></p>

`opencode-termux` packages OpenCode's official ARM64 musl build with the runtime required by Termux.

## Install

On Termux aarch64:

```bash
npm install -g opencode-termux
opencode
```

The first run prepares everything needed by the runtime automatically. It installs missing Termux packages, downloads the matching release, verifies it, and starts OpenCode.

## First-run experience

Installation is intentionally quiet. Instead of command logs, it only shows short status messages such as:

```text
  ◇ Setting up Termux dependencies…
  ✓ Termux dependencies are ready
  ◇ Preparing OpenCode for Termux…
  ✓ OpenCode 1.18.4-8 is ready
```

Detailed command output is kept hidden unless an error occurs.

## Automatic dependency setup

Before installing or starting OpenCode, the wrapper checks for the runtime prerequisites. When needed, it installs them through Termux's `pkg` command:

- `curl` for release downloads
- `tar` for archive extraction
- `patchelf` for the Termux-compatible ELF interpreter
- `coreutils` for the update timeout command
- `ca-certificates` for HTTPS certificates
- `resolv-conf` for the DNS configuration used by the packaged musl runtime

Node.js and npm are the only prerequisites because npm is used to install this package:

```bash
pkg install nodejs
```

## How it works

| Feature | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Verified downloads | The installer checks the release SHA-256 against `release-checksums.json` bundled in npm. |
| Complete runtime | The OpenCode binary, musl loader, `libgcc`, and `libstdc++` are stored in `~/.opencode/`. The packaged musl resolver uses Termux's DNS configuration, so API connections work natively on Android. |
| Safe updates | A newer npm package is installed first. The working runtime is kept if npm or the network fails. |
| Version matching | `~/.opencode/.opencode-termux-version` ensures the runtime always matches the installed npm package. |
| OpenCode updates | OpenCode's internal updater is disabled so it cannot replace the Termux-compatible binary. |

```text
opencode
  │
  ├─ Check and install missing Termux dependencies
  ├─ Check the installed runtime and its version marker
  │   └─ If needed: download → verify SHA-256 → test → activate
  ├─ Check npm for a newer package (up to 10 seconds)
  │   └─ If newer: install package → restart wrapper → install matching runtime
  └─ Run ~/.opencode/opencode
```

## Automated releases

The [Build and publish Termux package](.github/workflows/auto-update.yml) workflow runs every six hours and can also be started manually.

1. It detects the latest official OpenCode release through GitHub's API.
2. It downloads `opencode-linux-arm64-musl.tar.gz` and verifies GitHub's SHA-256 digest.
3. It packages the binary with ARM64 musl, `libgcc`, and `libstdc++` runtime libraries. The musl runtime is built from pinned source with Termux's resolver path so it can use Android DNS without Proot.
4. It creates the release archive and records its SHA-256 in `release-checksums.json`.
5. It publishes the npm package, creates the GitHub Release, and commits the generated checksum metadata.

Publish jobs are serialized. If npm already has a version but its GitHub Release is missing, the workflow stops instead of generating an archive with a mismatched checksum.

## Update or repair

Running `opencode` normally checks for updates automatically.

```bash
# Check the latest published version
npm view opencode-termux version

# Update immediately
npm install -g opencode-termux@latest
opencode

# Reinstall the managed runtime without deleting the current files first
rm -f ~/.opencode/.opencode-termux-version
opencode
```

## Uninstall

```bash
npm uninstall -g opencode-termux
rm -rf ~/.opencode
```

The second command removes only the runtime managed by this package. OpenCode configuration, if any, is normally kept in `~/.config/opencode`.
